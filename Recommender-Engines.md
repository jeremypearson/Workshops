# Recommendation Algorithms, building a recommendation system

## What?

Recommender systems have become extremely common in recent years, and are applied in a variety of applications.
The most popular ones are probably movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, 
and products in general. However they are also used in financial systems.

We will be building, mostly from scratch a simple recommender system. 

## What do I need to know?

There is some math in this tutorial, however I will cover all aspects rather extensively so no math knowledge
is needed (perhaps highschool?) i'll teach you any math concepts from a programmers perspective, which will give you 
understanding of what you are writing. 

Ability to read psedocode

Your favorite language. [Working demos will be written in python for ease of reading,
but you can impliment the system in whatever language you would like]

## Who is running it?

Adam Hibble

## When? 

From week ~6 I'll find out what dates best suits people who are interested

## Where

I'll book out a room and GP Campus

## Extra

I plan to do a more complex machine learning tutorial, this is a perfect preamble for that tutorial.
